            <h1 id="WhatsCuphead">Stages</h3>
            <p id="Place1"> Cuphead is a game that prides itself on boss battles. Every stage is a boss battle of some kind, as even the run n' gun stages have a mini-boss near the end. Even with there being a boss in every stage it doesn't mean the stages aren't varied. There are three different types of stages in Cuphead each having their own theme, setting, and feel to them. The three stages are Run n' Gun, Boss Battles, and Airborn Boss Battles. After every stage is completed you get a rating with a scorecard telling you how well you did on a level. The rating follows the standard grading format going down to a D and up to a S, depending on your diffuculty, with a secret P rating for a pacifists that beat run & gun stages perfect without firing your weapon.</p>

            <h2 id="Develope"> Airborn Bosses</h2>
            <p id="Para2"> Airborn bosses function the same as normal bosses except for one catch, they make you go into an airplane. The airplane is a mode of sorts for some airborn bosses that allowed cuphead to not be affected by gravity. During this time he loses his dash for a togglable speed boost and hitbox size reduction. The airplane can't be customized, but you can get a secondary attack later in Ink Isle II. For this mode your special attacks are set to firing a large missle and with full card meter you can turn into a missle for massive damage. Other than that they fuction the same as normal boss battles. </p>
