            <h1 id="WhatsCuphead">Stages</h3>
            <p id="Place1"> Cuphead is a game that prides itself on boss battles. Every stage is a boss battle of some kind, as even the run n' gun stages have a mini-boss near the end. Even with there being a boss in every stage it doesn't mean the stages aren't varied. There are three different types of stages in Cuphead each having their own theme, setting, and feel to them. The three stages are Run n' Gun, Boss Battles, and Airborn Boss Battles. After every stage is completed you get a rating with a scorecard telling you how well you did on a level. The rating follows the standard grading format going down to a D and up to a S, depending on your diffuculty, with a secret P rating for a pacifists that beat run & gun stages perfect without firing your weapon.</p>

            <h2 id="Develope">Boss Battles</h2>
            <p id="Para2"> Boss battles are different based on the boss that you fight. Each one has their own setting and theme that gives them variety. Bosses usually have a standard attack with different phases/transformations. During a transformation or phase the stage, attack, and boss can all change. Cuphead doesn't change in these only the bosses or stage do. After beating a boss you get a rating as you do with all the other stages. Cuphead has 15 boss battle stages with normal format. </p>
