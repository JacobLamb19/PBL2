            <p id="Place1"> Not much is known about Cuphead. We don't get much of an explanation as to their story other than Cuphead being greedy. We do know that he does care about people as he's willing to fight back against the Devil to save everyone's souls.</p>

            <h2 id="developer">Mugman</h2>
            <p id="Para2"> Mugman, much like his brother we don't know much about. We do see him as somewhat cowardly, but also one to think things through. He wanted to stop Cuphead from betting their souls, but even after it was Cuphead's fault he still helps out his brother and sticks with him thought thick and thin.</p>
