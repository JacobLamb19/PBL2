            <h1 id="WhatsCuphead">Stages</h3>
            <p id="Place1"> Cuphead is a game that prides itself on boss battles. Every stage is a boss battle of some kind, as even the run n' gun stages have a mini-boss near the end. Even with there being a boss in every stage it doesn't mean the stages aren't varied. There are three different types of stages in Cuphead each having their own theme, setting, and feel to them. The three stages are Run n' Gun, Boss Battles, and Airborn Boss Battles. After every stage is completed you get a rating with a scorecard telling you how well you did on a level. The rating follows the standard grading format going down to a D and up to a S, depending on your diffuculty, with a secret P rating for a pacifists that beat run & gun stages perfect without firing your weapon.</p>

            <h2 id="Develope"> Run & Gun Levels </h2>
            <p id="Para2"> Run & Gun levels have you control Cuphead and Mugman the same way that you would in boss battles. In these levels you aren't in a fixed position or forcing moving. You have a set area you can go and you move throughout the level trying to reach the end. You also have coins that you can collect in these levels that are exclusive to run & guns. Every run & gun has a mini-boss at the end of their level. They aren't too tough just a little stronger than normal enemies that present a tougher challenge than the onslaught of the normal enemies. </p>
